Basic interactive display

Some transitions or animations are not displayed, so I will briefly explain them in text:
1. Login and Register pages, what I expected was to swipe out from right to left
2. The function of uploading courses only requires the use of the secondary menu (similar to this form) and does not need to jump to the next page separately.
